# Netlify practice

I've used Netlify before, but only after it was setup. This repo is to practice setting it up in the first place. 

## Milestones

1. 25-Mar-2022   
   - Created the repo… well, _initialized_ the repo from the command line. (Until I created the repo in the GitHub UI--skipping the optional steps--, I couldn't push the new README, etc. to it.)
   - Updated the repo settings (no squashing or rebasing; drop wiki & projects); also updated `.git/config` to use my signing key.
      * updating `.git/config` wasn't the forcing-function I thought it would be--I wasn't prompted by Terminal to enter my passphrase on that commit.
      * I tried again, this time using `git commit -S -am` but that didn't do it, either. 
      * I'm trying one more time, but after having restarted my machine (my GPG credentials expire upon system restart). Fingers crossed.
