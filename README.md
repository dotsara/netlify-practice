# Netlify practice

I've used Netlify before, but only after it was setup. This repo is to practice setting it up in the first place. 

## Milestones

1. 25-Mar-2022   
   - Created the repo… well, _initialized_ the repo from the command line. (Until I created the repo in the GitHub UI--skipping the optional steps--, I couldn't push the new README, etc. to it.)
   - Updated the repo settings (no squashing or rebasing; drop wiki & projects); also updated `.git/config` to use my signing key. (Which didn't work initially, so… trying again?)

## Resources

- [Netlify](https://netlify.com): for deployment
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io): frontend framework
